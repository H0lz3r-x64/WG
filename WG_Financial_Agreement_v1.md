# Collective Financial Agreement for Shared Household

## Purpose of the Document

This document outlines the agreed-upon principles for collective management of shared household expenses in our WG. The goal is to ensure fairness in contributions while taking into account different financial situations and existing ownership of household goods. It incorporates principles of socialist fairness, while recognizing individual contributions and future earning potential.

# 1. Ownership of Pre-Existing Household Items

Maya has previously furnished an apartment and owns several items that will be essential for the shared household. These items include but are not limited to:

Furniture (e.g., couch, chairs, tables, etc.)

Household appliances (e.g., vacuum cleaner, washing machine, kitchen appliances)

Kitchen equipment (e.g., pots, pans, utensils)


## Transfer to Collective Ownership

Pre-existing items brought in by Maya will be transferred to collective ownership of the household, with the understanding that these items are now shared equally by all members. They will no longer be considered Maya’s personal property and will be used, maintained, and replaced collectively.

The goal is to minimize complexity and bureaucracy while ensuring that everyone benefits equally from what is already available.

## Credit for Contributed Items

To ensure fairness, the value of Maya’s contributions will be assessed, and she will receive a credit equal to the estimated second-hand value of the items contributed. This credit can be used by Maya to offset future expenses related to the household, such as:

- Monthly contributions to the collective budget

- Costs for new shared purchases (e.g., furniture, appliances, or other communal items)

- Repairs or replacements of communal property


## Guideline for Valuing Pre-Existing Items

### 1. Initial Valuation:

Upon moving in, the group will collaboratively assess the second-hand value of Maya’s pre-existing items. This will be a fair and transparent process, with all members agreeing on the approximate value of each item.

Valuation sources may include second-hand market prices, online price comparisons, or mutual agreement on a reasonable estimate.



### 2. Credit to Maya:

The total value of these items will be recorded, and a corresponding credit will be applied to Maya’s name.

This credit will not be a direct financial payment but rather a balance that Maya can use to cover her share of collective household expenses.

# 2. Contribution to New Shared Purchases

## Sliding Scale Model for New Purchases

For any new shared items needed for the household (such as additional furniture, cleaning supplies, or other communal items), we will implement a sliding scale payment model based on income.

This model is designed to ensure that contributions are fair while recognizing that different members of the household have different incomes. Contributions will be split as follows:

70% of the cost will be split equally among all members.

30% of the cost will be split based on individual income levels.


This ensures that everyone shares responsibility for new purchases while accommodating differences in financial means.

## Example:

### Step 1: Total Cost of the Item

- Item: New refrigerator costing €600

- 70% Split Equally:

    - 0.70 x €600 = €420

    - This will be split equally among all four members.


- 30% Income-Based Split:

    - 0.30 x €600 = €180

    - This portion will be split based on income.

### Step 2: Incomes of Each Person (imaginary)

- Maya: €1,500

- Elisa: €1,200

- Leon: €800

- Patrick: €500


---

### Step 3: Total Household Income

- €1,500 + €1,200 + €800 + €500 = €4,000


---

### Step 4: Calculate Each Person’s Proportion of Income

- Maya’s proportion: €1,500 / €4,000 = 0.375 (or 37.5%)

- Elisa’s proportion: €1,200 / €4,000 = 0.30 (or 30%)

- Leon’s proportion: €800 / €4,000 = 0.20 (or 20%)

- Patrick’s proportion: €500 / €4,000 = 0.125 (or 12.5%)


---

### Step 5: Calculate Each Person’s Share of the Income-Based Split (30%)

Income-Based Split (€180):

- Maya’s share: 0.375 x €180 = €67.50

- Elisa’s share: 0.30 x €180 = €54.00

- Leon’s share: 0.20 x €180 = €36.00

- Patrick’s share: 0.125 x €180 = €22.50



---

### Step 6: Calculate Each Person’s Share of the Equal Split (70%)

Equal Split (€420):

- €420 divided by 4 people = €105 per person


---

### Final Contributions:

- Maya:

    - €105 (equal share) + €67.50 (income-based) = €172.50


- Elisa:

    - €105 (equal share) + €54.00 (income-based) = €159.00


- Leon:

    - €105 (equal share) + €36.00 (income-based) = €141.00


- Patrick:

    - €105 (equal share) + €22.50 (income-based) = €127.50



This ensures that everyone contributes fairly without overburdening anyone based on their current financial situation.

# 3. Ongoing Shared Expenses and Collective Budget

For ongoing shared household expenses (such as cleaning supplies, toilet paper, or any other consumables), we will create a monthly collective fund to ensure these costs are handled smoothly.

## Monthly Contributions

Each member of the household will contribute to this fund based on the sliding scale outlined above. Contributions will be used for:

Routine purchases (cleaning supplies, communal toiletries, etc.)

## Repairs or maintenance of communal items

Future household investments (e.g., new shared furniture)


The group will collectively decide on the monthly amount based on projected expenses, adjusting as necessary.


---

# 4. Collective Decision-Making for Major Purchases

All major purchases that affect the entire household will be made based on a group decision. No individual should be expected to make a large purchase for the group without full consensus. Major purchases include but are not limited to:

New furniture for shared spaces

Large household appliances (fridge, washing machine, etc.)

Any item costing over €100


To approve a major purchase, the household will hold a discussion where all members can express their views. A majority vote is required to approve the purchase. All members are expected to contribute financially based on the sliding scale model once an item has been approved.


---

# 5. Future Financial Adjustments & Fairness Considerations

While some members of the household are currently earning more, others are pursuing higher education, which will likely result in higher earnings in the future. In recognition of this:

Should the income distribution among household members shift significantly during the time of living together, we will review the financial contributions and adjust them accordingly.

If, after completing their education, members start earning significantly more, they can retroactively contribute more to the collective budget or assist with future expenses as a way to balance past contributions.


This ensures long-term fairness and prevents any one member from being financially disadvantaged in the long run.


---

# 6. Duration of Agreement & Review

This agreement will remain in effect for the duration of our shared living arrangement. It is subject to review every six months, or earlier if requested by any member. Reviews will allow the group to assess the fairness of the current arrangement and make adjustments if needed.
